Objectivity and Climate Change

Tags: media literacy, climate change, objectivity, critical thinking, fake news, hurricanes

**Description:** This activity is intended as a case study to reinforce other lessons on media literacy and critical thinking. Students will read each of 3 excerpts about the influence of climate change in the 2017 hurricane season (at timed stations) and fill out a worksheet to identify sources of bias and rate overall objectivity. The teacher will then guide discussion of each source with the included presentation, which goes into additional detail about third-party measures of journalistic reputation and how you can independently investigate author and journal credentials. In particular, the presentation identifies major sources of conflict among the authors of Source C, and the Heartland Institute and the International Climate Science Coalition, which promote climate change denial through misinformation and marketing campaigns (and are likely funded by the fossil fuel industry, though they do not disclose funding sources anymore).

**Unit Length: **1 Day
